          Most applications will use an existing
          <a href="https://developer.github.com/libraries/">wrapper library</a>
          in the language of your choice, but it's important to familiarize
          yourself with the underlying API HTTP methods first.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's no easier way to kick the tires than through
          <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</a>. If you are using an
          alternative client, note that you are required to send a valid
          <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#user-agent-required">User Agent header</a>
          in your request.
        </p>
        <h2>Hello World</h2>
        <p>
          Let's start by testing our setup. Open up a command prompt and enter
          the following command:
        </p>
        <pre class="command-line command-line--input">curl https://api.github.com/zen Keep it logically awesome.</pre>
        <p>
          The response will be a random selection from our design
          philosophies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, let's <code>GET</code>
          <a href="https://github.com/defunkt">Chris Wanstrath's</a> [GitHub
          profile][users api]:
        </p>
        <pre class="command-line command-line--output">
<span class="command-line--comment"># GET /users/defunkt</span>
<span class="command-line--input">curl https://api.github.com/users/defunkt</span>
{
  "login": "defunkt",
  "id": 2,
  "url": "https://api.github.com/users/defunkt",
  "html_url": "https://github.com/defunkt",
  ...
}        </pre>
        <p>
          Mmmmm, tastes like JSON. Let's add the <code>-i</code> flag to include headers:
        </p>
        <pre class="command-line command-line--output">

        <p>
          There are a few interesting bits in the response headers. As
          expected, the <code>Content-Type</code> is <code>application/json</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any headers beginning with <code>X-</code> are custom headers, and are not
          included in the HTTP spec. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>X-GitHub-Media-Type</code> has a value of <code>github.v3</code>. This lets us know
            the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/media/">media type</a> for the response. Media types have
            helped us
            version our output in API v3. We'll talk more about that later.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take note of the <code>X-RateLimit-Limit</code> and <code>X-RateLimit-Remaining</code>
            headers. This pair of headers indicate <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting">how many
              requests a client
              can make</a> in a rolling time period (typically an hour) and how many
            of those requests the client has already spent.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="Authentication" class="main-section">
        <header>Authentication</header>
        <p>Unauthenticated clients can make 60 requests per hour. To get more requests per hour, we'll need to
          authenticate. In fact, doing anything interesting with the GitHub API requires <a
            href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication">authentication</a>.</p>
        <h2>Using personal access tokens</h2>
        <p>The easiest and best way to authenticate with the GitHub API is by using Basic Authentication <a
            href="https://developer.github.com/v3/auth/#via-oauth-and-personal-access-tokens">via OAuth tokens</a>.
          OAuth tokens include <a
            href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use">personal access
            tokens</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Use a <code>-u</code> flag to set your username:</p>
        <pre
          class="command-line command-line--input">curl -i -u your_username https://api.github.com/users/octocat</pre>
        <p>When prompted, you can enter your OAuth token, but we recommend you set up a variable for it:</p>
        <p>You can use <code>-u "username:$token"</code> and set up a variable for <code>token</code> to avoid leaving
          your token in
          shell
          history, which should be avoided.</p>
        <pre
          class="command-line command-line--input">curl -i -u username:$token https://api.github.com/users/octocat</pre>
        <p>When authenticating, you should see your rate limit bumped to 5,000 requests an hour, as indicated in the
          <code>X-RateLimit-Limit</code> header. In addition to providing more calls per hour, authentication enables
          you to read and write private information using the API.</p>
        <p>You can easily <a
            href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use">create a personal
            access token</a> using your <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">Personal access tokens settings
            page</a>:</p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="./assets/images/personal_token.png" alt="">
        <h2>Get your own user profile</h2>
        <p>When properly authenticated, you can take advantage of the permissions associated with your GitHub account.
          For example, try getting [your own user profile][auth user api]:</p>
        <pre class="command-line command-line--output">
<span class="command-line--input">curl -i -u your_username:your_token https://api.github.com/user</span>
{
  ...
  "plan": {
    "space": 2516582,
   "collaborators": 10,
   "private_repos": 20,
   "name": "medium"
 }
  ...
}        </pre>
        <p>This time, in addition to the same set of public information we retrieved for <a
            href="https://github.com/defunkt">@defunkt</a> earlier, you should also see the non-public information for
          your user profile. For example, you'll see a <code>plan</code> object in the response which gives details
          about the GitHub plan for the account.</p>
        <h2>
          Using OAuth tokens for apps
        </h2>
        <p>Apps that need to read or write private information using the API on behalf of another user should use <a
            href="https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/">OAuth</a>.
        </p>
        <p>OAuth uses tokens. Tokens provide two big features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Revokable access:</b> users can revoke authorization to third party apps at any time</li>
          <li><b>Limited access:</b> users can review the specific access that a token will provide before authorizing a
            third party app</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tokens should be created via a <a
            href="https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/">web flow</a>. An
          application sends users to GitHub to log in. GitHub then presents
          a dialog indicating the name of the app, as well as the level of access the app has once it's authorized by
          the user. After a user authorizes access, GitHub redirects the user back to the application:</p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="./assets/images/oauth_prompt.png" alt="">
        <p><b>Treat OAuth tokens like passwords!</b> Don't share them with other users or store them in insecure places.
          The tokens in these examples are fake and the names have been changed to protect the innocent.</p>
        <p>Now that we've got the hang of making authenticated calls, let's move along to the <a
            href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/">Repositories API</a>.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="Repositories" class="main-section">
        <header>Repositories</header>
        <p>Almost any meaningful use of the GitHub API will involve some level of Repository information. We can
          <code>GET</code> <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#get-a-repository">repository details</a> in
          the same way we fetched user details earlier:</p>
        <pre class="command-line command-line--input">curl -i https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap</pre>
        <p>In the same way, we can <a
            href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-repositories-for-the-authenticated-user">view repositories
            for the authenticated user</a>:</p>
        <pre class="command-line command-line--input">curl -i -H "Authorization: token 5199831f4dd3b79e7c5b7e0ebe75d67aa66e79d4" \
    https://api.github.com/user/repos</pre>
        <p>Or, we can <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-repositories-for-a-user">list repositories
            for another user</a>:</p>
        <pre class="command-line command-line--input">curl -i https://api.github.com/users/octocat/repos</pre>
        <p>Or, we can list <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-organization-repositories">repositories
            for an organization</a>:</p>
        <pre class="command-line command-line--input">curl -i https://api.github.com/orgs/octo-org/repos</pre>
        <p>The information returned from these calls will depend on which scopes our token has when we authenticate:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A token with <code>public_repo</code> <a
              href="https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/">scope</a>
            returns a response that includes all public repositories we have access to see on github.com.</li>
          <li>A token with <code>repo</code> <a
              href="https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/">scope</a>
            returns a response that includes all public and private repositories we have access to see on github.com.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/">docs</a> indicate, these methods take a
          <code>type</code> parameter that can filter the repositories returned based on
          what type of access the user has for the repository. In this way, we can fetch only directly-owned
          repositories, organization repositories, or repositories the user collaborates on via a team.</p>
        <pre
          class="command-line command-line--input">curl -i "https://api.github.com/users/octocat/repos?type=owner"</pre>
        <p>In this example, we grab only those repositories that octocat owns, not the ones on which she collaborates.
          Note the quoted URL above. Depending on your shell setup, cURL sometimes requires a quoted URL or else it
          ignores the query string.</p>
        <h2>Create a repository</h2>
        pFetching information for existing repositories is a common use case, but the GitHub API supports creating new
        repositories as well. To <a
          href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create-a-repository-for-the-authenticated-user">create a
          repository</a>, we need to <code>POST</code> some JSON containing the details and configuration options.
        <pre class="command-line command-line--input">
curl -i -H "Authorization: token 5199831f4dd3b79e7c5b7e0ebe75d67aa66e79d4" \
    -d '{ \
        "name": "blog", \
        "auto_init": true, \
        "private": true, \
        "gitignore_template": "nanoc" \
      }' \
    https://api.github.com/user/repos        </pre>
        <p>In this minimal example, we create a new repository for our blog (to be served on <a
            href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, perhaps).
          Though the blog will be public, we've made the repository private. In this single step, we'll also initialize
          it with a README and a nanoc-flavored <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore">.gitignore template</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The resulting repository will be found at <code>https://github.com/<your_username>/blog</code>. To create a
          repository
          under an organization for which you're an owner, just change the API method from <code>/user/repos</code> to
          <code>/orgs/
            <org_name>/repos</code>.</p>
        <p>Next, let's fetch our newly created repository:</p>
        <pre class="command-line command-line--output">
    <span class="command-line--input"> curl -i https://api.github.com/repos/pengwynn/blog</span>
 HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
{
   "message": "Not Found"
}        </pre>
        <p>Oh noes! Where did it go? Since we created the repository as private, we need to authenticate in order to see
          it. If you're a grizzled HTTP user, you might expect a <code>403</code> instead. Since we don't want to leak
          information about private repositories, the GitHub API returns a <code>404</code> in this case, as if to say
          "we can neither confirm nor deny the existence of this repository."</p>
      </section>
      <section id="Issues" class="main-section">
        <header>Issues</header>
        <p>The UI for Issues on GitHub aims to provide 'just enough' workflow while staying out of your way. With the
          GitHub <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/">Issues API</a>, you can pull data out or create
          issues from other tools to create a workflow that works for your team.</p>
        <p>Just like github.com, the API provides a few methods to view issues for the authenticated user. To <a
            href="https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/#list-issues-assigned-to-the-authenticated-user">see all your
            issues</a>, call <code>GET /issues</code>:</p>
        <pre class="command-line command-line--input">curl -i -H "Authorization: token 5199831f4dd3b79e7c5b7e0ebe75d67aa66e79d4" \
    https://api.github.com/issues</pre>
        <p>To get only the <a
            href="https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/#list-issues-assigned-to-the-authenticated-user">issues under
            one of your GitHub organizations</a>, call <code>GET /orgs/<org>/issues</code>:</p>
        <pre class="command-line command-line--input">curl -i -H "Authorization: token 5199831f4dd3b79e7c5b7e0ebe75d67aa66e79d4" \
          https://api.github.com/orgs/rails/issues</pre>
        <p>We can also get <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/#list-repository-issues">all the issues under
            a single repository</a>:</p>
        <pre class="command-line command-line--input">curl -i https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues</pre>
        <h2>Pagination</h2>
        <p>A project the size of Rails has thousands of issues. We'll need to <a
            href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination">paginate</a>, making multiple API calls to get the data.
          Let's repeat that last call, this time taking note of the response headers:</p>
        <pre class="command-line command-line--output"><span class="command-line--input">curl -i https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues</span>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
Link: <https://api.github.com/repositories/8514/issues?page=2>; rel="next", <https://api.github.com/repositories/8514/issues?page=30>; rel="last"
...          </pre>
        <p>The <code>Link</code> <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/LinkHeader/">header</a> provides a way for a response
          to link to external resources, in this case additional pages of data. Since our call found more than thirty
          issues (the default page size), the API tells us where we can find the next page and the last page of results.
        </p>
        <h2>Creating an issue</h2>
        <p>Now that we've seen how to paginate lists of issues, let's <a
            href="https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/#create-an-issue">create an issue</a> from the API.
        </p>
        <p>To create an issue, we need to be authenticated, so we'll pass an OAuth token in the header. Also, we'll pass
          the title, body, and labels in the JSON body to the <code>/issues</code> path underneath the repository in
          which we want to create the issue:</p>
        <pre class="command-line command-line--output">

        <p>A big part of being a good API citizen is respecting rate limits by caching information that hasn't changed.
          The API supports <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#conditional-requests">conditional requests</a> and
          helps you do the right thing. Consider the first call we made to get defunkt's profile:</p>
        <pre class="command-line command-line--output">
<span class="command-line--input">curl -i https://api.github.com/users/defunkt</span>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
ETag: "bfd85cbf23ac0b0c8a29bee02e7117c6"        </pre>
        <p>In addition to the JSON body, take note of the HTTP status code of <code>200</code> and the <code>ETag</code>
          header. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag">ETag</a> is a fingerprint of the response. If we
          pass that on subsequent calls, we can tell the API to give us the resource again, only if it has changed:</p>
        <pre class="command-line command-line--input">
curl -i -H 'If-None-Match: "bfd85cbf23ac0b0c8a29bee02e7117c6"' \
   https://api.github.com/users/defunkt
<span class="command-line--output">HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified</span>        </pre>
        <p>The <code>304</code> status indicates that the resource hasn't changed since the last time we asked for it
          and the response will contain no body. As a bonus, <code>304</code> responses don't count against your <a
            href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting">rate limit</a>.</p>
